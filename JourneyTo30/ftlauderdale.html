            <h2>Birthday Girl: Gabrielle, 30</h2>
            <p>For Gabrielle's birthday, we took off to Fort Lauderdale for some fun in the sun. Though relaxation was the goal, we ended up partying the night away in true girls' trip fashion.<br></p>

            <div><p>Again, we flew Frontier Airlines. This 4-hour trip called for a comfortable chair, so we used a bundle that they offer. This bundle is $150 for two bags, the first-class seat, and roundtrip, bringing our flight total to $275. If we didn't get the perks, the flight was only $125 roundtrip. Not bad at all.</p>
        
            <p>We stayed at the Crowne Plaza Fort Lauderdale, gaining more IHG points. This hotel wasn't beachfront; however, we were only a few miles away from the nearest beach. The four of us split a two-bed room and paid $69/night + tax; about $58 per person for the stay. </p>
        
            <p>One of the best decisions we made was renting a convertible Mustang. Miami is only 30 minutes from Ft. Lauderdale, so we cruised along the beach and looks so cool. I rented this car for $200 for four days. </p>

                <p>There are so many places to eat in Florida, but only these restaurants are a must-try.</p>
                <h3>Catfish Dewey's</h3>
                <p>Right in Fort Lauderdale is a seafood haven, Catfish Dewey's. This restaurant is full of surf and turf and is a cute little local hangout. The sea bass was amazing. The bartender helped us plan our adventure and got us on the VIP list for a nightclub.<br></p>
                <h3>Duffy's</h3>
                <p>After a day at the beach, we found the closest restaurant to us, Duffy's Sports Grill in North Miami. Apparently, this restaurant is a corporate chain, but I have never seen such a place. We sat on the humungous patio that overlooked the water. People could dock their boats at the restaurant, and as a mountain girl, this was a first for me. Even better, the bar had a full-sized pool and patio games. Epic!</p> 
                <h3>Sanguich de Miami</h3>
                <p>I love Cubano sandwiches. Everyone I talked to in Florida told me that this restaurant is a must-try. I was not disappointed. This small cafe has many different types of Cubanos and other Cuban dishes. Sanguich de Miami is located in Little Havana and has a distinct Cuban architecture and charm.

                    <p>For our group of four, we took a party boat that took us from Fort Lauderdale to Miami and back. This boat had a fully stocked bar and a captain that showed us all of the sites. We had a perfect party, all to ourselves.</p><p>Tickets for this was only $50 per person and included the open bar. We were entertained for six full hours. Plus, we didn't have to deal with any crowds.</p>

                    <div id="beachP"><p>Sunny Isles Beach is a pure paradise. We arrived at this beach to find almost nobody there. We laid in the sun all day. The water was crystal blue. They have chairs and umbrella rentals, as well as food trucks lined up along the street. It is located between Fort Lauderdale and Miami Beach making it very convenient to plan the rest of the day. However, I came dangerously close to a shark. What's an adventure without a little drama?
                </p>
                <p>We paid $10 for parking, and the beach was free.</p></div>

                    <div id="havanaP"><p>I loved Little Havana.  From the cigar shops to graffiti, everywhere you turn, there is art and culture. Not to mention, it is so close to South Beach. This place takes you on a bonus vacation to Cuba.</p><p>This cost us nothing to explore. And...the cigars were cheap and authentic.</p></div>
