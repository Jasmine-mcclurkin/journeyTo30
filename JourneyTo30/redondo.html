            <h2>Birthday Girl: Jayla, 8</h2>
            <p>Though this journey was to celebrate a group of gals turning thirty, we couldn't forget about the little lady of the group, Jayla. During this year of adventure, Jayla turned 8, and we took off to Redondo, Beach.</p>

        <h2>Accomodations</h2>
        <div class="articleBorder">
            
            <div><p>We took flight with Frontier Airlines. Since Frontier Airlines is based out of Denver, they have a group called Discount Den, which gives discounts out to its members. The membership is $69 a year and worth it if you travel a lot domestically. They also have "Kids-Fly-Free" days! We took a non-stop flight, including baggage and seat selection, for $227 ($113 per person).</p>
        
            <p>We stayed at the Crowne Plaza Redondo Beach. I also have a membership with IHG, so I earn points every time I visit one of their hotels. The hotel was steps away from the beach, pier, and beachfront restaurants. Plus, the hotel had a full-sized pool and a very relaxing hot tub. We stayed here for $80/night + tax for three nights, totaling at $269 ($135 per person).Plus, Free breakfast!!</p>
        
            <p>We planned on exploring California, so we rented a hybrid for $66 for three days </p>

                <p>There are so many places to eat in California, but only these restaurants are a must-try.</p>
                <h3>Ruby's Diner</h3>
                <p>Right on Redondo Beach is Ruby's diner. This restaurant is kid-friendly with a 1950s vibe. It was directly across the street from the hotel, and their food was delicious and fun. Also, right next door is a small water park!</p>
                <h3>Shorty'z</h3>
                <p>A short drive away in Orange County, is my favorite restaurant in California, Shorty'z. This mom and pop shop is a breakfast joint that is made to order and full of greasy goodness. Be prepared to wait, though. This place always has a line.</p> 
                <h3>Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles</h3>
                <p>Last but not least is Roscoe's. This restaurant not only has the best chicken in California; it is full of history. Celebrities from all walks of life gathered at Roscoe's to enjoy a meal, free of judgment or prejudice. There are locations throughout California, but you can see the Hollywood sign from the one on Gower St.

                    <h3 class="colTitle">Universal Studios Hollywood</h3>
                    <p>Though Disneyland is known for its magic, Universal Studios gives you more bang for your buck. In this fun-filled day, we went on virtual rides like Transformers and the Simpsons. These rides are thrilling for adults, yet suitable for an 8-year old. We ended the day taking a tour of the studio lot, seeing Bates Motel and running into King Kong himself.</p><p>Tickets for this park is $200 per person, but this doubled as her birthday gift, so it was worth it. Plus, we went during the week, so that we didn't have to buy a fast pass to ride everything.</p>

                    <h3 class="colTitle" id="col2Title">Santa Monica</h3>
                    <p>Visiting the Santa Monica Pier was one of the highlights of our trip. We sat on the beach for half of the day, while vendors circled us with a variety of snacks. Then, we dried off on the rides and saw the sunset from the top of the rollercoaster. The pier had plenty of shops, food, and of course, ice cream cones to end a perfect day.
                </p>
                <p>Tickets for unlimited rides are $32 for adults and $18 for kids. We paid $10 for parking, and the beach was free.</p>

                    <h3 class="colTitle" id="col3Title">Hollywood Blvd.</h3>
                    <p>We saw so much action on Hollywood Blvd. Of course, we trolled the Star Walk. We also saw the Chinese theater, street performers, and tours galore. From the top of the mall, we had a premier view of the notorious Hollywood sign. I also cleared out on souveniers</p>
                    <p>This cost us absolutely nothing to explore. And...the souvenirs were extremely cheap.</p>
