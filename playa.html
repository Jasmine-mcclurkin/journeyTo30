            <h2>Birthday Girl: Shavon, 30</h2>
            <p>Shavon took us to a hidden paradise, Playa del Carmen. As a 5 person girls trip, we thought we would get into the most trouble. However, we found this oasis to be a bonding experience we will never forget. From getting lost in the dark jungle, to literally laying by the pool all day, this adventure is just what we needed. </p>

            <div><p>We took flight with United Airlines on this four-hour journey. We flew into Cancun for $467 roundtrip, including seat selection and baggage. Carry-on baggage is free with United, so I suggest making it work. Outside of the airport, we were greeted by dozens of people offering us a ride, but we already had one. We rented a private shuttle on our hour road trip from Cancun to Playa del Carmen. The shuttle cost $12 per person, and the driver even stopped by the convenience store so we could grab some Modelo.</p><p>Then, we arrived in heaven.</p><p>The Occidental at Xcaret  all-inclusive resort was more than we could imagine. We purchased the royal package for $314 per night and were welcomed with a personal valet and a ride to our suite. This package included an exclusive restaurant and pool, concierge service, and other VIP perks. Our suites were spacious and are a perfect fit for three people each. The balconies have a hammock and a huge hot tub.</p>

                <h3>Eat. Sleep. Repeat.</h3>
                <p>During this trip, we mastered the art of eating and sleeping, all next to our private pool. We spent hours under the sun with no need to move at all. We had a poolside server that brought us beverages and items from the pool menu. There were never more than five other people in the gigantic pool, so we had the freedom to be our silly selves. When we wanted more of a crowd, we went to their community pool, which stretched throughout the resort. That one doesn't have a server, but the swim-up bar is pretty cool.</p>
                <h3>Solarium and Inlet</h3>
                <p>When we weren't at the pool, we were at the solarium or the inlet. The solarium overlooked the water with a breeze like no other. We had a server to bring us beverages; therefore, we didn't have to move a muscle. The inlet is kind of like a beach but without sand. Instead, it has a soft, but rocky terrain with tons of little fish that eventually leads out into the gulf. There are hammocks, a swimming area, a bar, and a restaurant. </p> 
                <h3>Spa</h3>
                <p>After a long day of doing nothing, we treated ourselves to the spa. We got an hour-long massage, which brought me into a deep sleep. Then, we received a 100% natural facial with local herbs. We got manicures and pedicures. It was a perfect self-care regimen.

                    <p>Our resort was located in the heart of the Rivera Maya jungle. We saw no shortage of wildlife. Monkies scaled the resort balconies eating bananas and papayas from our hands. There were many lizards and other tropical creatures.</p>

                        <p>Every night, we headed to the Discoteca and danced the night away. They played the latest American hits, Reggaeton hits, and traditional Mexican music. It was nice to mingle with other people our age. The DJ took requests. Discoteca is a great place to host a birthday party.</p>
